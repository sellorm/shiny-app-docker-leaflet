# Shiny app using leaflet in a docker container simple example repo

This repo is a modified versions of the repo that  accompanied the article [here](https://blog.sellorm.com/2021/04/25/shiny-app-in-docker/).

It's a simple [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)  app borrowed from the leaflet docs.

Everything else in this repo is a toy to demonstrate how the project layout should work.

## 'shiny-app' directory

This directory contains only those things which are needed for the app to run.
In our case that's just the `app.R` file.

Again, these files are demostation toys. Your applications and data will naturally be more complex.

Please see the blog post at the top of the README for more information.
